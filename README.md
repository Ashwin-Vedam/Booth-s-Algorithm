# Booth's-Algorithm
Overview

This project implements Booth's Algorithm in C for multiplying signed binary numbers using two’s complement representation. Booth’s Algorithm optimizes multiplication by reducing the number of arithmetic operations, making it more efficient than standard binary multiplication.

Features

Accepts two signed integers as input.

Converts numbers into binary (two’s complement form if negative).

Uses Booth’s Algorithm for multiplication.

Displays step-by-step computation.

Outputs the final product in binary and decimal formats.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: C

Concepts: Bitwise operations, Two’s Complement, Shift-and-Add Multiplication
